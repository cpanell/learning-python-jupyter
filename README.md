# learning-python-jupyter

## Purpose
This is a repository for guided projects that I completed in the course of learning Python for Data Science.  

## Contents
List of Jupyter notebooks containing the results of each project from most recent to earliest.
* **Building a Handwritten Digits Classifier**
